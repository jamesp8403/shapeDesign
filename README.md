# shapeDesign
## **Description**

This is a shape overlaying design exercise created in HTML. The sizes, colors, shapes and positions were created to adhere to strict guidelines.

## How to Run

This project doesn't need much to run. Since it's a still image, you can clone the repo and load the HTML file on your system. You can feel free to change the 
design by using the HTML file.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

I really enjoyed working on this project. I look forward to making more designs in the future.
